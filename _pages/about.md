Bienvenido, Welcome to Yuanzhe's Homepage! 
======
I am a Ph.D. student majoring in Computer Engineering at the University of Oxford, working as a postgraduate research assistant at the Oxford e-Research Centre [(OeRC)](https://oerc.ox.ac.uk/) with Professor [Min Chen](https://sites.google.com/view/mchen). My current work focuses on quality assurance in machine learning applications which combines human and machine strengths in the machine learning model training and testing process. I am also an invited editor for Springer, IEEE Access, and a student member of IEEE Region 10(Asian-Pacific) and ACM SIGCHI. 

My research interests include: 
 * Visualization
 * Intelligent User Interface
 * Machine Learning Model Quality Assurance
 * Biomedical Data Analysis

Previously, I was a master's student at Northwestern University in the USA working on applying machine learning applications in embedded systems and autonomous driving.
