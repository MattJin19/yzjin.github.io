Abstract
===
With the development of instant messaging tools, an increasing number of emojis are being used in daily online communication. Different individuals may have varying interpretations of the same emoji or other "visual symbols". These differences in understanding can sometimes lead to difficulties in comprehending the meaning of conversations. Previous research has shown that there are widespread differences in emoji usage habits across different age groups. In this paper, we focus on the differences in the understanding of various emojis between parents and children when communicating through instant messaging tools. To help parents better communicate with children, we introduce large language models (LLMs) to analyze conversations, aiming to assist parents and children in better understanding their online interactions. Through the experiment and evaluation, LLMs show the ability to be a solution for improved cross-generational communication for emoji understanding.
